            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Farhad, a 3rd year CSE student at AIUB. I really like making websites and 
                learning about computers. Right now I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also 
                want to learn more about cybersecurity because I think it's cool how we can protect 
                systems from hackers.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not studying, I like to watch coding tutorials online and practice building 
                small projects. My goal is to become a good web developer and maybe work at a tech 
                company after I graduate. I'm still learning but I'm excited about it!
            </p>
