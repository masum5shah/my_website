      <h2>The Future of Artificial Intelligence in 2025</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the past decade. From self-driving cars to advanced chatbots, 
        AI is now part of our daily lives. In 2025, we're seeing incredible advancements in natural language processing, 
        computer vision, and machine learning algorithms that are reshaping industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most exciting developments is the rise of generative AI models that can create art, write code, 
        and even compose music. These tools are empowering creators and developers around the world to build 
        innovative solutions faster than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with great power comes great responsibility. Ethical concerns around AI bias, privacy, and job 
        displacement are becoming increasingly important. As future tech professionals, it's crucial that we understand 
        both the potential and the challenges of AI technology.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters More Than Ever</h2>
      <p>
        In today's interconnected world, cybersecurity is not just an IT concern—it's everyone's responsibility. 
        With cyberattacks becoming more sophisticated, businesses and individuals must stay vigilant to protect 
        sensitive data and maintain privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        From phishing scams to ransomware attacks, hackers are constantly finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities. 
        That's why learning about network security, encryption, and ethical hacking is so important for computer 
        science students.
      </p>
      <p>
        At AIUB, we're learning about firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure coding practices. These skills 
        will be essential as we enter the workforce and help organizations defend against cyber threats.
      </p>

      <h2>Web Development Trends You Should Know</h2>
      <p>
        Web development is evolving rapidly. Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular have revolutionized how we 
        build interactive user interfaces. Meanwhile, backend technologies like Node.js and Python are making it 
        easier to create scalable web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Responsive design is no longer optional—it's a necessity. With mobile traffic accounting for more than half 
        of all web traffic, developers must ensure their sites work seamlessly across all devices. That's where CSS 
        frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS come in handy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are also gaining traction. They combine the best of web and mobile apps, 
        offering offline functionality, push notifications, and fast load times. If you're serious about web development, 
        PWAs are definitely worth exploring.
      </p>

      <h2>The Rise of Cloud Computing</h2>
      <p>
        Cloud computing has transformed the way businesses operate. Services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud 
        allow companies to scale their infrastructure without the need for expensive hardware. This flexibility has 
        made cloud computing essential for startups and enterprises alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a student, understanding cloud platforms can give you a significant advantage in the job market. Learning 
        about virtual machines, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes will open up many 
        opportunities in DevOps and cloud engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cloud computing also plays a crucial role in AI and machine learning, where massive datasets require 
        powerful computing resources. With cloud-based GPUs and TPUs, researchers can train complex models 
        without needing their own supercomputers.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning to Code: Tips for Beginners</h2>
      <p>
        Starting your coding journey can feel overwhelming, but remember: every expert was once a beginner. 
        The key is consistency. Try to code a little bit every day, even if it's just for 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't just watch tutorials—build projects! Whether it's a simple calculator, a to-do list app, or a personal 
        portfolio website, hands-on practice is the best way to solidify your understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join coding communities like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Reddit. Don't be afraid to ask questions and learn 
        from others' experiences. The tech community is incredibly supportive, and you'll find plenty of people 
        willing to help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, embrace failure. Every bug you encounter and every error message you read is a learning opportunity. 
        Debugging is a skill that takes time to develop, but it's one of the most valuable skills you can have as a 
        programmer.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Technology is constantly evolving, and staying updated with the latest trends is essential for success in 
        this field. Whether you're interested in AI, cybersecurity, web development, or cloud computing, there's 
        never been a better time to learn and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep experimenting, keep building, and never stop learning. The future of tech is bright, and you have the 
        power to shape it!
